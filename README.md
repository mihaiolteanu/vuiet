# Vuiet

![melpa](https://melpa.org/packages/vuiet-badge.svg)

Vuiet is a music player and explorer for Emacs users. It is similar in scope to
[lastfm](https://last.fm) on which it is based. All tracks are played from
youtube using mpv in the background and music info taken from last.fm. Vuiet
supports the "discovery mode", where it lets you create your own playlists based
on artist, genre or your loved songs similarities. Or, you can specify single
tracks, top tracks from a given artist, known albums, etc. There is also a
lyrics database that is optionally updated with each track you play and this
database can be searched interactively and played from.

youtube changes its algorithms frequently to prevent third party users (us) from using it.
```bash
sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
```
- [lastfm](https://last.fm) account, API key, and the
