# Vuiet, the music player and explorer for Emacs

Playing and discovering new music from within Emacs has never been easier. With
vuiet you can,

- Search and play any song, artist or create your own playlists which you can
  listen.

- Playlists can be created on a multitude of criteria. Most of the playlists
contain a fixed number of songs which are played one after another. But some
playlists are able to pick songs at random, indefinitely.

- Playlists can be created from:
  - songs from a given artist
  - all the songs from an artist's given album
  - songs from artists similar to a given artist, taken at random
  - songs from artists with the given genre
  - all the user loved songs, sequentially or at random
  - songs from artists similar the user loved songs artists
  - songs similar to the currently playing song

- Take advantage of lastfm's huge music dataset to figure out what are an artist
top songs, the similarities between artists, each artist music genre, a user
loved songs and listening history, etc.

- Search all the tracks on youtube and play them in the background with
mpv, so not music files are necessary on your machine.

- Display an artist or music genre in an interactive buffer from which you can
  direcly play songs or explore similar artists or genres.

- Display the lyrics for the currently playing song and save it in a local
  database.
  
- Search through all the lyrics in your local database and select a song to play.

Vuiet has the music discoverability factor of lastfm or spotify but with the
comfort and power of Emacs.

## Music player

You can ask vuiet to play random tracks from random artists similar to an artist
you already know and like. For example,

```emacs-lisp
(vuiet-play-artist-similar '("steven wilson"))
```

There is no limit to the number of artists specified in this call. New tracks
will be selected from random artists similar to artists from this list. The
number of similar artists and the number of top tracks to consider, among
others, is fully [customizable](#customization).

Or you can play random tracks from random artists that are tagged with any of
the genres you specify,

```emacs-lisp
(vuiet-play-tag-similar '("classic rock" "80s"))
```

There are multiple variations on these two type of playlists, some of them
random and basically infinite, others finite and sequential, some based on
artists, other on genres or on lastfm user loved tracks or even single track play,
given directly or from a lyrics search. The posibilities are endless. See the
[playlists](#playlists) section for details.

## Music browser

Besides the player, there is also an explorer. I won't bore you with the
details, just know that you can call it, and then explore everything on that
page. Handy for picking out specific tracks for listening or for casually
browsing similar artists or genres.
 
```emacs-lisp
(vuiet-artist-info "steven wilson")
```

## Search, browse and play from lyrics

Google is nice for searching that song that's in your head. But sometimes you
just can't find it. Either the lyrics are too general and Google finds only
cr**, either your track is obscure enogh that nobody has heard about it.

Either way, you can save the lyrics for each song you play with `vuiet`. All
your saved lyrics are searchable, filterable and playable. Having a Google-like
search for your local database of lyrics can come in handy.

Here, let me show you,

```emacs-lisp
(vuiet-play-track-by-lyrics "secret")
```

`Vuiet` searched through all the lyrics in my database for the ones that contain
`secret` in them.  Hit `<enter>` on any song from that list, and `vuiet` will
play it. Nice, eh?

# Requirements

The recommendation system is based on [lastfm](https://last.fm). So you should
have a lastfm account and the
[lastfm.el](https://github.com/mihaiolteanu/lastfm.el) package installed
first (see the lastfm.el README for details). The tracks themselves are taken from
youtube via [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) and played
with [mpv](https://mpv.io/) in the background (i.e. with the --no-video
option). You should have both of them installed.
