;;; Commentary:

;; Vuiet is a music player and explorer for Emacs users. It is similar in scope
;; to lastfm on which it is based. All tracks are played from youtube using mpv
;; in the background and music info taken from last.fm. Vuiet supports the
;; "discovery mode", where it lets you create your own playlists based on
;; artist, genre or your loved songs similarities. Or, you can specify single
;; tracks, top tracks from a given artist, known albums, etc. There is also a
;; lyrics database that is optionally updated with each track you play and this
;; database can be searched interactively and played from.
